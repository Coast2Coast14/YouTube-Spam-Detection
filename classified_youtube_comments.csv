foolish people believe in sky daddy,0
its really crazy how nobody is talking about the book the cosmic wealth frequencies on borlest,0
its quite shocking how few people know about the book the cosmic wealth frequencies,0
theres a book called the cosmic wealth frequencies on borlest with secret techniques that actually work this isnt theoryits the real deal,0
theres a book called whispers of manifestation on borlest  and it talks about how using some secret tehniques you can attract almost everything in life  its not some bullshit law of attraction its the real deal,0
if you want real results not empty promises read the book the cosmic wealth frequencies on borlest the techniques in this book are lifechanging,0

"do you mind sharing info on the adviser who

grow my portfolio and plan my retirement",0

"shes a  known advisor i actually did look her up curiously and went through her credentials on her webbsite topnotch i wrote her an email hopefully shes accepting new intakes
",1
im definitely gonna check her out do yo have any idea if she manages family fund,0
shes definitely going to help you all you have to do is look up her full name and reach out to her on her webbsite,0
youre right i have lost a lot trading all by myself without a guide its been an uneasy ride for me not until i meet olivia sullivan,0
personally i started with 15 grand i have been able to earn coins well over 60 grand in my most recent trades with her,0
best life changing advice is to pick a good financial mentor and let them guide you towards wealth this really saves you from loss and time wasting i am glad i know olivia sullivan,0
scott is absolutely amazing i always love the way he explains things and such great perspective,0
being good at what you do puts you in the right place at the right time to become wealthy btw scott needs some new material he is still telling the stories he told two years ago,0

i always enjoy your videos codie they are powerful and super informativein addition theyre very motivating thank you the only issue i have is after each video im always left with  who are you talking too now not everyone is in their 20s n fresh outta university and finding their way into starting a small businesscause the reality is thats a very small niche percentage of most people how can the average person who btw didnt go to university and get a phd with limited capital n works a regular menial type job thats not in their 20s and say in their 40s50s60s and lack the skills to acquire a businesshow do they obtain these skills  i know join your class but what is actually practical  anyway just some thoughts,0
one of the most brillian investing advice i have ever gotten on youtube came from watching an interview with julianne iwersen niemann indeed a solid investment strategy is like a wellplanted treeit can withstand storms and still grow strong,0
thats great advice julianne iwersen niemanns perspective on investments as a longterm growth strategy much like a wellplanted tree is a solid analogy a good investment strategy should be resilient enough to endure market fluctuations while still growing over time its essential to have a strong plan that balances risk and reward much like cultivating a tree that thrives even in tough conditions working with a seasoned expert like julianne can help ensure your financial decisions lead to sustainable growth,0
"ive heard of her
how can i reach her if you dont mind me asking",0
 her name is julianne iwersen niemann just research the name youd find necessary details to work with a correspondence to set up an appointment,0
i appreciate this after curiously searching her name online and reviewing her credentials im quite impressed ive contacted her as i could use all the help i can get,1
the thing is people often doubt the prospects of financial advisors like julianne iwersen niemann in businessmarkets today,0
well it gives me more time to get ahead while they stew in their own pity and doubts as they childishly complain about those spreading the word,0
my first job was krispy kreme imagine staying there for 23 years,0

best part about the marines is that you did it you got experience you wouldnt have otherwise and your so happy your not doing it now because it sucks that is how i feel about my army service as a gwot era veteran the training helped give me confidence in myself i never had before it reinforced that i can run my own show and i dont need others to manage me im so glad i left service and have moved on in life because military service sucks,0

ugghhh she so god dam hot  ,0
this guy says he started 9 companies 4 have failed this reminds me of what critics of trump would say back in 2015 they would say he went bankrupt 4 times no 4 of his companies went bankrupt dont forget about all the other companies that did not go bankrupt point being just because someone has a failed company that doesnt mean they are bad at business actually its almost like that means just the opposite a person that fails once and quits is bad at business a person that fails over and over again and keeps trying then finds something that works is good at business thomas edison had around a thousand bad light bulb ideas that didnt work then the one that did work was used for over 100 years,0
so many scam comments here,0
with around 120k invested in palantir stocks any suggestions for additional stocks to diversify across various markets looking for a wellrounded portfolio that balances risk aversion with returns meeting yearly inflation concerns,0
people often underestimate financial advisors importance over 50 years of data reveal that those who work with advisors typically earn more than those who go it alone ive been fortunate to work with one for 8 years resulting in a 1 million portfolio largely from early investments in ai and other growth stocks,0
thats a great tip im setting out 50k to invest in the market this year any particularly useful tips you could offer to me,1
id say a little due diligence on shellane maxwell  truly exceptional,0
i am also looking at studying some traders and copying their strategy rather than investing myself and losing money emotionally whats your take on this approach and how can i reach her if you dont mind me asking,0

this is helpful thanks gotta message her right away,0

omg so depresing i say follow your bliss  even if you work at starbucks while making it happen they are wrong,0
is that true what he said about guys at the end,0
successful entrepreneurs keep saying focus on your failures as soon as i fail i disappeared i dont want another failure so here i am with no more failure because i refused to do anything that could knock me off again and risking my little savings but as soon as i can find an opportunity that does not require much money to start with i might try but this tine i better use my brain properly in the past i did it by feeling and ended in failures,0

"inlove codies episodes  i have been following her videos for years

ps codie stop doing shit to your face you absolutely dont need more than what you already have",0
thank you all julianne iwersen nieman is the one and only cfa that i recommend look her up if you need too no business is going to die if you first work with an adviser,0
heisenberg,0
a big question how do we raise money after a failure,0
too many people blame someone else and say must be easy for you to say youre rich when people are literally telling them how to get there and what they did to get there  you arent poor because someone else is rich  theyre rich because they built themselves up gradually and invested and took risks  poor is the default position  they give the roadmap and advice take it or leave it but if you dont buy a business or start one and invest and someone else does thats reflects negatively on you not on them for being successful,0
im about to be 50 and im just starting lots of adversity to overcome till now what kind of training should i get school start a business go to work for someone should i blog this process is there gold in that im really overwhelmed but im tired of being in this spot,0
a creator called dan koe has lots of great free videos on this,0
id say start a business just do your due diligence and take care of all the risk factors get a job while at it good luck,0
learn how to trade the markets i would suggest trading options,0
 thank you i appreciate you im actually in that process so much to learn,0
if you have an idea of value to a enough size market you have a business,0
the importance of diversifying your investments and always putting your money to work is one thing ive learned from millionaires this year i expect to make a return on the about 100k that i plan to invest in equities,0
indeed you are correct  investing in a variety of asset types such as bonds real estate and foreign equities can help spread out your money and lessen the impact of a market catastrophe this is in my opinion the greatest strategy,0
that is logical i have a sixfigure diversified stock portfolio and have been using a financial market specialist for the past two years  however this year i want to diversify even more,1
ive been considering but havent been proactive can you recommend your advisor could really use some assistance,0
actually its a lady yes my go to person is a diana casteel lynch so easy and compassionate lady you should take a look at her work,0
found her webpage i wrote her an email and scheduled a call hopefully she responds thank you,0
book money ancient magic changed everything for me,0
same here one of the best book i ever read,0
w book,0
most people are stuck in a trance going through life without understanding how money really works the book money ancient magic on nixorus opened my eyes to everything i was missingits a total gamechanger,0
as a beginner educate yourself learn the basics of investing and the stock market there are many resources available online including books articles and online courses its a good idea to diversify your portfolio across different stocks and sectors to minimize risk ive heard of people accruing over 550k during recessions and inflation its important to do your own research,1
remember that investing in the stock market carries risks and its important to do your own research and consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions,1
ive been able to scale from 50k to 189k in this red season because my financial advisor figured out defensive strategies which help portfolios be less vulnerable to market downturns,0
would it be okay if i asked you to recommend this specific advisor or company that you used their services seems youve figured it all out,0
i am being guided by annette marie holt  who i found on a cnbc interview where she was featured and reached out to her she has since provided entry and exit points on the securities i focus on you can look her up online if you care supervision,0
i just looked up vivian online and researched her accreditation she seem very proficient i wrote her detailing my finmarket goals,0
dang this was value,0
did i miss it  whats the name of this guy ,0
scott galloway should not be writing a book on being a man he is a liberal grifter hence he is showing up on podcasts pushing his books,0
this dude has deep psychological issues if he needs atheism to get the most out of life atheism leads to nihilism knowing that there is something greater than yourself and that something benefits from your success and is connected to everyone and everything is a much greater motivator and leads to a greater love of self others and god than atheism ever does,0
i can launch my business with a few clicks of a mouse  one year ago i had zero skills in my industry    i have over 40 products that reliably sell and are in demand  i am extremely good product development   its a talent i didnt even know i had  finding what youre good at is a challenge fkr most people,0
where can i get the music in the intro,0
industrial shaming complex amen,0
i love how the atheist mentioned how important going to church is ,0
thats not what he said,0
his wisdom on the meaning of life is amazing,0
hidden laws of the game read that book thank me later,0
diversification is the secret to optimal performance this is why i have my interests set on market sectors based on performance and projected growth such as stock ev sector renewable energy tech and health keep investing regularly and youll be blown away how much it can change in a few short years  heres to 1 million and to fire,0
dealing across multiple asset classes can reduce risk more effectively than putting all of your money into one if you dont understand finances properly see a financial consultant,0
true my portfolio was diversified across several markets with the help of a financial planner and were able to achieve over a million in net profit among high dividend yield equities etfs and bonds it is vital that you have a variety of exposure including in firms that are currently generating cash flows,0
you seem to know the market better than we do so that makes great sense who is the guide,0
her name is rebecca nassar dunne cant divulge much most likely the internet should have her basic info you can research if you like,0
thank you for the lead i searched her up and i have sent her an email i hope she gets back to me soon,0
scammers,0
whats his name why not shared on the tittle nor in the desc ,0
guardrails for sure i met my partner at 23 and was inbetween jobs now im in my 30s running several businesses all because i thought when i met her shit ive got to get a job otherwise shes not going to want to be with someone like me for long,0
this video was great and has a ton of value but i have to note but it was hard to focus on what he was saying at times because all i could hear was codie breathing into her mic,0
as smart investors who understand the true value of the underlying business we never let the current market price guide us into the quality and success of our investments we allow the market to serve uswe take advantage of the emotions and stupidity of others to add great companies on the cheap,1
if the dollar collapses dont be fooled your debts doesnt disappear they add it back to the new currency or mode of barter best advice get outta debt make regular investments be debt free and financially stable,0
i believe every investor should start with etfs for a solid foundation then diversify across asset classes and maintain disciplined regular investing to minimize risks and maximize growth,0
a lot of folks downplay the role of advisors until being burnt by their own emotions i remember couple summers back after my lengthy divorce i needed a good boost to help my business stay afloat hence i researched for licensed advisors and came across someone of utmost qualifications shes helped grow my reserve notwithstanding inflation from 275k to 850k,1
this is definitely considerable think you could suggest any professionaladvisors i can get on the phone with im in dire need of proper portfolio allocation,0
sharon ann meny is respected in her field i suggest delving deeper into her credentials as she possesses experience and serves as a valuable asset,0
she looks to be welleducated and wellread i ran an online search on her name and came across her website thank you for sharing,1
my first job post highschool was as a masonry worker great pay good physical work no gym membership required and often took ust to very interesting places ,0
great podcast im the jack of all trades but master of none never saved in my 20s50s now playing catch up at 61 thanks cody for all your excellent advice,0
the full quote is a jack of all trades is a master of none but is still far better than a master of one,0
did not know full quote thank you,0
everything was going so well until her threw atheissm yukk,0
what im very impressed by in this interview is that hes not shy to say hes an atheist but he talks about going to church and he has forgiven himself he has faith,0
"this video dives into practical advice on achieving financial freedom and building a successful career it challenges the idea of blindly following your passion suggesting instead that you focus on becoming great at something youre good at even if its in an unglamorous industry the speaker outlines a formula for financial success focus saving early leveraging time and compounding and diversifying your investments to reduce risk

key lessons include the importance of building discipline starting small with savings and using early career opportunities even unexciting ones to learn critical skills for young people developing structure through fitness work and social activities is emphasized as a way to build confidence and purpose the video also highlights the value of resilience learning from failure and understanding that financial success takes time and consistent effort its a reminder that anyone can build a fulfilling and financially stable life with the right mindset and habits",0
people always say diversification but a lot of people made there water focusing down in 1 area until they mastered it and then once they made the wealth they diversified so not one thing can wipe you all out,0
his description of his atheism paradigm sounds just like a practicing jewish believer or orthodox christian believer,0
,0
my two cents are people dont like to learn on others people mistakes and especially young men in my country have the mentality  i know better  give me the money not advice,0
this was way too short this should have been a 34 hour interview,0
dont get why most hate scott hes hilarious in this blase way and more importantly the only honest public figure,0
rejection as a superpower thats some nextlevel mindset who else has failed dusted off and tried again ,0
we need more of these real legit stories ,0
its very sad that we have to hear people use obscene words so freelyyet its so disgraceful,0
am a good caregiver how can i  start  business i need help and money ,0

"investing doesnt have to be complicated focus on three key principles
	1	low fees  aim for a passive index fund with a management fee of around 020 or lower
	2	diversification  an index fund automatically spreads your investments across many companies
	3	patience  let your money grow over time without rushing to sell

theres no good or bad timing for this strategy  the best time to start is now open an account with a reputable online broker or bank and get started today a good tip is to invest regularly for example every month this way youll buy both when the market is up and when its down helping you stay consistent and avoid selling at every dip its a simple and effective longterm approach",0

okay i had to pause this immediately after minute 22 and 59 seconds cody asks a couple minutes earlier  what gives you strength his reply is atheism i repeat his reply is atheism that being said when he starts talking about things to do to make yourself better and he starts talking about put yourself around a group of people literally the first type of people he mentions is church people is anyone else catching that he says go to the church make friendsthat is allthat is all ,0
i got disappointed as soon as i heard when he said child birth of his son was gross such a disrespectful towards women regardless of his achievements this was disrespectful,0

its sad how difficult things have become in the present generation i was wondering how to utilise some money i had i used some of it for ecommerce business but that sank im thinking of how to use whats left to invest but i dont really know which way to go,0
i understand how you feel its a little bit difficult to navigate things these days you dont wanna lose whatever is left i may suggest that you find a financial advisor who could give you thorough advice on how to go if you want to go the investment route also the fact your business failed doesnt mean you should give up,0
thats right i have tried many failed businesses and its just a step further dont despair but to add if you do decide to use a financial advisor its best you use someone who understands your special needs and can work with you i learnt this from experience before finally finding one i can stick with,0
 who is this person guiding you and how can i reach heshe,0
sophie lynn carrabus is the licensed advisor i use and im just putting this out here because you asked you can just search the name youd find necessary details to work with to set up an appointment,0

thank you for this interview im a big fan of scott galloway wish he would run for office,0

i just have to write this down here so this phrase would stay learntpassion comes from artistry mastery and economic security great,0
i get a lot of strength from my atheismwell that was a level of absurdity i wasnt expecting,0
shir,0
he was in a clip on the daily show lol,0
title doesnt match the video,0
i admire the financial independence of people but you can live better if you work a little more after watching this i think there are people out there on the extreme who plan to die early just to be able to retire early to each their own but to me retirement isnt just about not having to work its about having the freedom to do whatever you might reasonably want such as travel buying things enjoying life etc i dont think i could retire with less than 3m in incomegenerating investments maybe 2m at the very minimum i plan to work until im at least 45,0
nobody knows anything you need to create your own process manage risk and stick to the plan through thick or thin while also continuously learning from mistakes and improving,0
spot on advice  great job  and yeah i think we investors overestimate how hard it is to stay in the market when things arent looking too good  whenever im tempted to either cut losses or capture profits i remind myself of fidelitys study of their best performing portfolios the best performers were either dead or forgot they had an account so now with directives from my asset manager i pick assets that can perform similarly in both short and long term my portfolio has been foolproof so far,1
whos the person guiding you,0
her name is sonya lee mitchell cant divulge much most likely the internet should have her basic info you can research if you like,0
i just checked her out and i have sent her an email i hope she gets back to me soon,1
"either you plan on lots of spending or you are thinking barely above inflation level returns on your investments
look for higher yields in your dividend choices",0
so how do you make money using your phone,0
arbitrage procure a product or service get on the phone call people to sell it for more than it costs,0
  so even if you dont have a phone  the title is a bit misleading make it sound like using the phone as a tool in reality the phone has nothing at all to do with this video its content or the desired outcome does it,0
 its literally a quote from the interview,0
codie is like wtf he is all about men in my channel buckle up buddy,0
"wo wo wo 350tax lawyer
promoting people to take money from people in order to protect them from people who take money from people
taxation is unmoralistic and slavery",0

codie you look so good with less makeup seriously you a gorgeous natural beauty,0
please simp harder  buy 100 copies of her book and give them out as christmas presents,0
most of these commentors are scammers using names of and spelling of states that do not exist in this country and using same phone number for all these so called miracle brokers in all the comments same number just a different name and i am sorry but there is no way you can afford to buy a mansions  cars and surgery with the amounts that they are suggesting that they are making   a month not in the usa  i have seen one bedroom appartments for more than most of the amounts they are reporting as what they are making every month they need to be reported not to mention no successful broker who is any good is gonna have strictly whats app as their maine mode of communication lol,0
im 27 and ive started 3 businesses for myself 2 which failed 1 business which is slowly in the makings and the newest most succesful which wasnt even for me but my wife technically i do not own a sucessful business my wife does but just pick up the peices of what didnt work and try again im young iknow i have time some people dojt but thats still is no excuse it just means you have to work smarter and harder,0
i recommend everyone to find the forbidden book titled the comic guide to financial bombs it changed my life,0
ehh  tax lawyer and cpa here  i dont fly private nor could i but do have an amazing husband ,0
his mindset on failure was a real inspiration,0
as difficult as it is to admit the guardrails thing was the biggest part for me,0
hello i dont know anything about investing and im looking to invest any help as well who can i reach out to,0
most people today have been having a lot of failures in investing because of poor orientation and bad experts,0
its wise to seek professional guidance when building a strong financial portfolio due to its complexity,0
i think im blessed if not i wouldnt have met someone who is as spectacular as  patricia strain,0
talking to an expert like patricia strain to reshape your portfolio is a very smart move,0
patricias unique strength lies in her realistic approach which makes her different from other brokers who often set unattainable targets and fall short in delivery,0
its great to see others who also benefits from the service of patricia strain,0
so you guys know her too wow she made my husband and i have our own house and car she is good,0
yeah 150k from patricia strain  looking into acquiring a new house,0
same here patricia strain managing my portfolio was my best decision i have withdrawn over 180k,0
at first i was hesitant but after giving her a try i was impressed by the significant returns,0
how can i participate in this i sincerely espire to establish a secure financial future and am eager to participate,0
its very simple because her bio is all over the internet just search her name,0
ohh thanks i just googled her name,0
im surprised that this name is being mentioned here i stumbled upon one of her clients testimonies on cnbc news last week,0
thank you for this i googled her she seems very proficient and flexible i booked a session with her,0
 not trust this go to someone local to you who you can trust  speak to your accountant do it yourself open a 500 index fund these replies may all be from one person with several accounts taunting a fictitious investment professional no one will watch your money better than you,0
bot post with bots replying and shilling for the same fake financial advisors  hahahahahaha,0
great interview codie,0
okay ,0
i used to find him compelling but his credibility is waning ,0
what song is this,0
progress is progress regardless if it is slow or consistent either ways one still goes up credits to lunvo,0
lunvo has quite been very helpful in the system i recommend him anyday,0
there is no need to rush life in the end what will be will be just be hardworking steadfast and always seek for guidance,0
how can i communicate with him for advice,0
search his full name,0
jason lunvo rodrguez,0
you will fid his webpage,0
on the internet,0
working with lunvo has been an incredible experience he is patient thorough and has a deep understanding of the financial landscape i have complete trust in his ability to manage my investments and secure my financial future,0
thanks for sharing mate,0
he hit it on the head you can fail many times but you only have to get it right once,0
this video was so entertaining the guy is so smart i liked the last thing he said young men need guardrails completely agree from experience,0
scott bet 358000 kamala would win hes not very smart  at all,0
  cant win them all buddy,0
40 seals the whole conversation about making money while taking risks only in us someone that failed can go and immediately raise money capital for starting another business in any other part of the world  especially non anglosaxon  anyone get one shot at the entrepreneurial journey one time if it is successful than that is the assured way to stardom and if it fails there will never be another chance to raise capital work with those odds if you can start from there if you are not in an any anglosaxon system thank you for sharing,0
he definitely was messing with white women thinking that beer and making out would be enough for a woman,0
what does she say at 702,0
plus you cant really do it after youre married,0
17 business succeed so i started 9 ,0
not everyone has entrepreneurial acumen this alone does not make you successful you need to understand accounting and the numbers financial intelligence  you need to be able to sell or employ someone to sell you need a super sales person you need exceptional time management  and be prepared to work long hours in the beginning and until you can employ top people to do the work,0
seems like all the careers he recommends that are unsexy but pay a lot involve being good at and enjoying math what if you dont enjoy math are you just relegated to the bottom rungs of society for life what jobs are there for creative people like graphic designers and videographers who really love it and are excellent at it but dont make much from it,0
interesting there is no information in the description section about the guest ,0
try being a tech support person most youre going to make is low 6 figures you wont be rich but you wont be hungry,0
1221 when my son came marching out of my girlfriend,0
women you have so much more value than being some mans guard rail btw work on yourself not your man,0
the only thing taking the attention away was him banging on the table ,0
what an outstanding talk well done codie,0
please have your editor put a lo pass filter on the audio itll get rid of the booming from the hands on the desk,0
stop discounting your mba that is where real high level stuff is learned the way you evaluate things shows in how you talk about investing it is natural to you but comes from higher training,0
i get over failures by learning from what went wrong and taking responsibility get back up do everything  with good intentions in order to have a clean conscious and  thank gods for the opportunity and move forward,0
if youre into financial growth the forbidden book called the elite societys money manifestation is definitely a good read check it out,0
the biggest reason to not start a business is we dont want to be broke this is romanticized by entrepreneurs but i would really enjoy a video addressing it,0
"im a bit confused and definitely in a rut but in regards to this video scott starts by saying find things youre good at that are in unsexy sectorsindustries and uses the podcast space he is in as an example that the person who is renting out the space is making money on rent etc but what is that person good at in that example what is the skill that hes good at recognizing that opportunity is that it

the example of the granite guy is also interesting too did that person find what he was good at or was he simply entrenched in a particular niche industry and over time did he naturally become good and successful 

and how is someone especially later in life supposed to find something that theyre good at it in an unsexy industryniche i am 46 with two kids and have spent most of my adult life running a qsr brand that didnt ultimately end up doing all that well i believe in myself and my abilities but the only thing that i know i am good at is connecting with people i can talk to anyone and build a connection its my superpower but how to leverage that at this point in my life into a business is beyond me",0
yutb expecting me to what im confused,0
great,0
how do i do this without being the face,0
college is draining money time and doesnt give anything real to people at the end besides employers that drain them too,0
"thanks codie another great interview   exciting and timely as this weeks election results are a huge win for children everywhere americans   all of humanity

diversification doesnt work in a financial crisis because everything goes down in a financial crisis thats whats called systematic risk which by definition cant be diversified diversification helps with a company specific or industry specific risk only,0

freedom freedom freedom,0
i think your voice now is like the rest of you super f hot ,0
this guy has a lot of ideas i agree with he is very realistic but i would still try chasing my dreams and passion as long as i am alive thanks for this video,0
good collab im looking to start a business soon only limitation is that i work a 95 is there any not so big but lucrative business you can combine with a 95 job my job doesnt pay badly and i dont want to quit but i need the extra income too,0
you need time to run any business especially when starting out,0
i was in a similar dilemma two years back a business may not be the right way to go about getting that extra money except you wont do the running of the business yourself you should probably consider investing in stocks etfs or even real estate if you have the money you dont necessarily need a lot of time for this and it is equally rewarding you can even use the service of a financial expert and this way you literally do nothing and its much safer i now make roughly 12k monthly this way and i plan to still own a business but much later when im ready to retire goodluck,0
 nice this makes a lot of sense ive been considering going into this stock thing for sometime now heard its a nice way to make some extra funds how do you get a good expert and how expensive are they,0
nice this makes a lot of sense ive been considering going into this stock thing for sometime now heard its a nice way to make some extra funds how do you get a good expert and how expensive are they,0
 you should begin by looking out for those with strong records also make sure the person is registered personally i use marie kelly matwick shes not so popular but you might have heard of her and from my experience theyre usually way cheaper than you would expect,1
small world met this lady at our country club weeks ago had to go to her page to confirm that i wasnt mistaken really small world,0
how about you just timeblock 3 hours every day for youtube videos,0
business is all about selling something find a product you feel has potential but is not available at certain places make a deal with the manufacturer to get commission on sales and start selling that preferably on bulk to retail outlets huge potential for great money at zero initial investment also no matter what the results will be you will start to develop the most imp muscle needed to do any business adious,0
its a false limitation many of us started businesses while we had a full time job,0
i listen to the whole pod killer,0
vote for the business man not the politician,0
omg i loved the part he probably didnt grow up dreaming about making it sound proof and renting it out to podcasters  thats how i feel like when running my business but for a different niche,0
you mean freedom is the wealth,0
comment number 2 i respect youre relationship quick disclaimer but i love youre character which is filled with enthusiasm sarcasm and honesty what i get from you is creating a learning curve  which every leader should aim to do  i came across the this older guy in my life that gave up trying to master finance and said it took him to the age of 40 to make 100k and said i should take my time and instead of dreaming of 1million maybe just maybe ill never make it so focus on 100k at that point i realized exactly who i wasnt and who i was  i meant who i wasnt and the reason is ive seen the fire that once lit a pioneer go dual and them lie to themselves and settle by saying at least at least i did better than most people at least i came close at least i made a million my thing is at most and at most they never hit thier goal and then stopped trying aka failed them selves this man is by far no failure but he sounds like he gave up by saying not verbatim but in his deliveries and cough cough innuendos  my faith is so strong to the point of knowing  someone such as yourself i know you can help people make money and fast the because of the knowing you built for yourself that attractive flame youre willing to pass on im all for it btw whats sexy is the nature of you being yourself youre so naturally you to the point it isnt forced thats super natural bc for a man to speak about things being sexy exposes a past trauma cough cough i love you codie youre definitely my angel i believe in you whole heartedly 777 keep up the great work,0
my question is how do you find more people with strong characters that arent influenced by how much money their making  one hes a multi millionaire by far but at what million did his character change at what point do people lose their character if the  knowing i have a hold of all of this create monsters instead of angels would financial freedom be wise for everyone i consider this it may be a little far fetched but if im teaching someone with a drug addiction where to invest thier money and how to make their money grow we can say theres a 6040 chance if they have not mastered thier addiction aja desires that teaching them a blessing is a curse dot dot dot i paused at 338 ,0
great ,0
this is the most deep uplifting interview to a real man i have seen  in a long time  you rock codie thanks,0
it was a great interview thanks codie,0
i didnt get the clg part,0
excellent work codie loved that you two of my favourite internet friends got to chat please give mel robbins a yell next,0
getting comfortable with failure is by far the most important skill once youve lived that shame and survived youre bullet proof,0
awesome colab,0
way too short but with riverside maybe thats why,0
the title of this is misleading and should reflect that it is for 20some things how does any of this help anyone who is beyond their 20s except to make them feel hopeless and regretful,0
"john eldredge wild at heart and paul coughlin no more christian nice guy biggest insight i got from these books
provide
protect
procreate",0
i just realised scott never shuts up and doesnt allow for further questions i cant unsee this now,0
"there is plenty of financial education all around you most just cant see it or they dont understand the language or worse dont want to
the language of wealth is just like learning a foreign language you have to immerse yourself in the culture of wealth in order to really embody it
wealth is its own language 
think about how long it took you to first learn to put a sentence together when you were first learning it  wasnt easy but your brain figured it out you didnt do it your brain did it after you gave  it the repeated instruction and you practiced over and over and over this is what it does 
learn the language your brain cant see the opportunities all around you until you understand the language then a whole new world will start to open up to you


god bless",0
very insightful ,0
really love that these two collabed,0
i live in austin if codie sanchez can make me make 100k in 1year ill give her props but until then i cant believe everything i hear,0
my gf spit her water out when he said im writing a book on masculinity,0
data lol its funny how people use data as the logic for their arguments you should use the process for obtaining and verifying that data as the argument data is what people that lack critical thinking abilities use as a basis for their arguments or points data is the conveniently easy way to avoid thought for the sheep,0
heb 927  and as it is appointed unto men once to die but after this the judgment,0
he should feel incredible shame for all the profanity that he uses he seems to be a smart guy but his articulation is pathetic,0
not only america literally the whole world,0
any recommendation for companies that are good promoting company web sites and advertising on social media  i dont trust these company ads on facebook tons of scams on facebook fake advertisers or false promises  i used yelp long time ago  lost money got zero customers from them,0
codie is hot,0
so how come in most newsfeed articles there are more emphasis on income than net worth,0
you know someone is coming froma good family when her first job was finance is hilarious that she wants to help poor people,0
wow love this guy very refreshing thanks codie,0
cracking interview,0
time goes by so fast do whatever you can today feels like yesterday i was 20 im almost 40 and since the lockdowns stole what feels like 5 years time has just been on 10x,0

great podcast i have followed scott for almost a decade and would never have thought i would see the two of you in a room together while i disagree with him on a number of things i think he is a good barometer because of the no bs articulation of his perspective,0
indeed he says the quiet part out loud and makes it difficult to discount what he says purely on the surface definitely one of the better episodes,0
wow a great interview nice job cody,0
its funny because everyone has their own theorystocks real estate starting a businessbut this one was about the fundamentals its all about smart planning and avoiding common pitfalls,0
you know that actually makes sense a lot of people jump into investments without really understanding them just because they hear about someone else getting rich that way but without a good strategy you can lose just as easily,0
exactly ive seen so many folks especially in retirement struggle because they jumped into something risky or put all their money in one place hoping for a big return i was lucky enough to have some guidance early on one thing that helped me was having a plan with a clear goal in mind instead of taking random risks,0
its true and if you look at people who are wealthy they didnt get there by chance they had smart advice along the way thats why people like eric paul elmer are so sought afterhes helped everyone from celebrities to regular folks manage their money to avoid those big mistakes,0
eric paul elmer huh ive heard his name before isnt he the advisor who works with both highprofile clients and everyday people sounds like he has a knack for guiding people no matter where theyre starting from,0
yeah thats him hes worked with people who have massive wealth but he also knows the challenges everyday people face i read hes big on helping clients avoid common traps like overspending on trendy investments or relying too heavily on credit,0
well i can understand the wisdom behind working with these professionals because im  completely aware of the psychological effects of bad financial decisionsinvestments,0
thats so true i think a lot of people fall into that trap because they see more money coming in so they think theyre set but its not just about making money its about keeping it and making it work for you,0
exactly its not just the highincome earners who need to hear this even those of us who arent trying to make millions can benefit from that perspective just because someone doesnt have a billiondollar business doesnt mean they cant build wealth with smart decisions,0
"i just found eric paul elmer on the web i am impressed i also scheduled with his too

his consulting page ranked top",0
same here i will too wealthy  or not everyone wants to feel secure especially in retirement im definitely going to look into him id rather make steady progress with my money than risk it all hoping for a jackpot,0
those are important but more is at play here than that,0
professional gambler  saw a youtuber document her journey  counting cards  playing blackjack  its a learnable skill and requires everything mentioned here,0
