0,Wow.. He started investing when he was 13 years old and he also owns two homes. What in the world are we doing with our lives? Lol,0
1,This is a PRIME example of strong family values and structure in setting up your children for success.  There's a strong push for education from his family.,0
2,Smart kid. His perseverance and proactive approach to life will get him far. All the best to you Ethan!,0
3,"This is the type of guy you don't tell your Asian parents about if they like to compare others to you.
All jokes aside, wow, this guy is a great example of what hard work and delayed gratification can achieve.",0
4,It is always good to have a financial plan. I work with a professional planner and a fixed-income strategist in NY. the fixed-income portion of your portfolio won't simply serve as a buffer to the volatility of the equity portion of your portfolio but will provide legitimate income.,1
5,"College in 2 years in CS at Berkeley and a 1 year Master is the most underrated thing here, this is not easy, I’m a physician now and I don’t know if I could do that.",0
6,man......this guy is an absolute genius at 22 years old.....i was knucklehead alcoholic...wish i could go back in some way. He's a perfect example of raised by good parents and strong family background. Kudos man.,0
7,"Good family support, educated, invested early, homeowner, good job. Well done, young man!",0
8,He's an bright individual. Down to earth. Makes mistakes and learns from them. Love it.,0
9,"Such a smart, accomplished young man!! Wishing him all the success in the future!",0
10,"I wasn't financial free until my 40’s and I’m still in my 40’s, bought my third house already, earn on a monthly through passive income, and got 4 out of 5 goals, just hope it encourages someone that it doesn’t matter if you don’t have any of them right now, you can start TODAY regardless your age INVEST and change your future! Investing in the financial market is a grand choice I made.",1
11,"At the beginning of the year, I gradually increased my stock purchases, but nothing significant. Why am I being so harsh with this? Despite the fact that others in my sector make six figures per person, I still want to be the first member in my polygamous family to earn a million dollars. I am well aware of the expenses incurred by putting in longer hours to earn more money.",1
12,"From another young tech professional to another, this is the way!
Kudos to you, man! Love to see when merit pays off. Keep the grind up :)",0
13,"To my understanding this just proves how much we need an edged as an investors because playing the market like everyone else just isn’t good enough. I’ve been quite ensured about investing in this current market and at the same time I feel it’s the best time to get started on the market,what are your thoughts?!",1
14,"I wish he credited his family for the knowledge of knowing about financial literacy at a young age - that is a HUGE advantage. I also advise if possible to not trade yours college years. Getting a rental property in another state and only making $200 with no mention of property taxes. While planning is good, life can have unexpected twists. It’s important to have a balance and also be present.",0
15,He has gotten a lot right at a young age.  Well done.,0
16,This guy seems to have his mind set on his goals and very organized. Keep up the good work towards the FIRE goal!,0
17,This young man is amazing. So determined and hardworking. Plan everything so well and stick with it.,0
18,One of my favorites! This is what happens when you understand that money is to be used as a tool and not served  as a master. Tfs😊,0
19,"Losing out on college years is priceless. You can always be sound financially later on. But Berkeley isn't the most fun university so I don't blame him. Good job Ethan, you're very mature for your age.",0
20,For real 😭,0
21,"Pay attention to what he says at 6:10, he saved up alot more by living with parents and living frugally. He was able to save 95% of his income. 
Try renting alone and you'll realize it's almost impossible to save up enough as you will spend over 50% on just rent especially in silicon valley or anywhere in oj county, the more expensive place in SoCal.",0
22,The power of education and hard work!,0
23,​ @chrisalarcon17 he was born smart,0
24,"Something doesn’t add up. His income is close to $200K and he saves $60K over two years? And he says he was saving 95% of his income? His current housing cost (main and rental) is about two thirds of his take home pay. Although his rental breaks even on the mortgage (+$200), he is not adding the cost of insurance / maintenance for the property, and if the tenant becomes delinquent, he can easily lose money. His mortgage for his main residence is also very high.
Hopefully that will go down once interest rate drops. It’s a tall order to say he “owns” two properties when they are mostly owned by the bank. And already he wants to acquire a property every two years. My gut feeling is that he may be too aggressive with his investment strategy (crypto, using leverage etc.), and he is not making as much gains as expected with a conservative investment strategy. I am curious to see what his actual net worth is. But so far numbers don’t look that great. And he wants to hit 5 million net worth in 10 years to achieve FIRE. And the mention of credit card debt is alarming if he calls himself frugal (maybe he put the AC on the credit card).",0
25,​ @MachaLatte123 I agree 60k is not enough.,0
26,"This is assuming parents let you save your money. Knowing many east asian, Indian, pakistani, etc parents. Many expect their kid fresh out of university to start paying all the household bills. Good luck saving 5% let alone 95%. The key is selfless prideful parents who won't take a penny from their kids.",0
27,"​ @Misaka-gt5yj  Key word is ""frugally"". Too many people are spending more money than what they actually make on fast food and top name brand clothing.",0
28, @MachaLatte123 He said he lived with his parents initially in order to save 95% of his income and therefore allow him to make the real estate purchases.,0
29,​ @MachaLatte123  A little over-leveraged for having 2 properties. Google income is good but that is a job and layoff can happen anytime. It just take bad tenant or a property crash for a wipe out.,0
30,Yes it’s all debt,0
31,He had parents that didn’t force the “just work & go home” mentality. They imposed more than just basic living,0
32,This is not uncommon in Asian community. Parents set up the rich and bright future for their kids by investing in their kids at very young age,0
33,Always someone younger and better than you ! I started investing at 27 after paying off 250k student debt . Now I own some single families in CA and small apartments in OK for 50 units .,0
34, @MachaLatte123 his parents helped him,0
35, @MachaLatte123  eeww matcha latte 🤢,0
36,​ @Misaka-gt5yj My 17 year old son does the same... He's extremely prudent in nature but he also knows that he can live with us as long as he likes rent free and he has more savings and investments than most adults 20 years older than him!... He also decided to go down the apprentice route rather than stack debt in university... I've absolutely no doubt what so ever that he'll become a millionaire!,0
37,Plus he was surrounded with friends who are well educated and investing. That really push him to be on top than the average teen.,0
38," @404fulmike  Yeah absolutely. But I think the main thing is his parents taught him well and put an emphasis on work ethic and education while growing up, thus building a foundation. Sadly I can't say the same for many other families who continuously pass on generational poverty 1 after another. They struggle to break that cycle.",0
39,"Also, parent's money and attention. He didn't have to worry about coming up with the resources to make up any deficit. His parents got him covered, and good on them for doing so!",0
40,Nah. Not hard work. Not “hard work.” /,0
41,"I remember just after my layoff early 2020 admist COVID outbreak, I needed to stay afloat,hence researched for licence fiduciary advisors. Thankfully I came across someone of practical knowledge,and decades of experience.I liquidated 200k of 325 k from my 401K, it has yielded nearly 1M after subsequent investments.",1
42,"I'm currently looking for where to begin putting in some funds that will aid me after retirement. Saving up isn't giving anything in return.
It's no secret that the role of financial advisors can never be downplayed.
Who's your advisor if you have any?",1
43,"Female financial advisors are doing way better than the male ones now, The likes of Lauren Simmons, Kathy lien and the most successful of them all LUCY ROSE CARTER 🔥",1
44,"I have shuffled through a few experts in the past,but settled with LUCY ROSE CARTER.the strategy they use is recession-proof,more specifically profit-oriented.most likely you will find her basic info on the internet.",1
45,"LUCY ROSE CARTER is the CFP responsible for my portfolio success,the lady has a private client base you can confirm her yourself on the internet, regulation and all.",1
46,"I started out with LUCY ROSE CARTER,great advisor. I got very lucky to have found her especially after my marriage crisis & consider her a good friend now.",1
47,"How can I join in? I will be happy growing my money while giving a few of it away to charity giving back is a good as receiving.
I don't mind consulting a female financial advisors if she can be of help to me",1
48,"Having an investment adviser is the best way to go about the market right now especially for near retirees. I've been in touch with LUCY ROSE CARTER for a while now mostly because I lack the depth knowledge and mental fortitude to deal with these recurring market conditions. I netted over 70k$ during this dip, that made it clear there's more to the market that we average joes don't know",1
49,LUCY ROSE CARTER,1
50,"I wonder where she gets her analysis from though,I just read her resume ONLINE I'm quite impressed ✅",1
51,Nah. Not most underrated thing here. Not “most underrated thing here.” /,0

55,"I understand that tomorrow isn't promised to anyone, but investing today is hard for me now because I have no idea of how and where to invest in. I would be happy if you could advise me based on how you went about yours, as I am ready to go the passive income path.",1
56,"Even with the right technique and assets some investors would still make more than others, as an investor, you should’ve known that by now, nothing beats experience and that’s final, personally I had to reach out to a stock expert for guidance which is how I was able to grow my account close to a million, withdraw my profit right before the correction and now I’m buying again",1
57,please who is the expert guiding you? i have lost so much as a beginner investing into stock without a proper guidiance of an expert.,1
58,"There are many you could potentially find online. I personally work with Kate Elizabeth Amdall  , and she's been spectacular. But there are also many others you could check out yourself.",1
59,I just checked her out and I have sent her an email. I hope she gets back to me soon.,1
60,"If the market has taught me anything, it's that it usually makes a comeback, but I can't seem to concentrate on the long term, especially because important things like my retirement and my reserve are having a disastrous impact on inflation. I need a solution and a data trajectory that I can trust as soon as it is practicable.",1
61," @AnnieBeischel  Currently, the best market strategy is to work with a credible investing coach. Since a while ago, I've been in touch with a coach, mostly because I lack the depth of understanding and mental toughness to deal with the ongoing market conditions. You lack the information necessary to succeed in a competitive market, not because you're doing anything wrong, but rather because of your lack of experience.",1
62," @MollyLogan-   Due to the significant falls, I need advice on how to rebuild my portfolio and develop more successful tactics. Where can I find this coach?",1
63,"In fact, I'm not sure whether I'm allowed to mention this, but I'd advise looking up ""Stacy Lee Decker"" because she was a big deal in 2020. She oversees both my portfolio and serves as my mentor",1

65,"I can’t focus on the long run when I should be retiring in 3yrs ,you see  I’ve got a good companies in my portfolio and a good amount invested, but my profits has been stalling,does it mean this unstable market doesn’t provide any calculated risky opportunities to make profits?",1
66,There are a lot of strategies to make tongue wetting profits especially in a down market but such sophisticated trades can only be carried out by proper market experts.,1
67,"How can I reach out to this coach? Because I’m seeking for a more effective investment approach how good is this person at portfolio diversification, particularly with regards to digital assets?",1
68,She appears to be well-educated and well-read I ran a google search on her name and came across her website; Thank You for sharing.,1
69,"easy for you to say not to trade your college years. I also graduated 2.5 years early simply because I could not afford it, and as an international student, I also could not get any federal loans.",0
70,"$200 cash flow while gaining equity is good, actually.  much better than having his money stagnant in a savings account",0
71,Not.,0
72,"The 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 years probably weren’t too much fun for many students, though.",0
73,"He move his life so fast. He need to learn how to spread things out throughout his lifespan or else he will hit a period of depression and boredom. I'm happy he made it that far at such a young age but he lost so much values of what life is. The more he grow up, the more he realize his mistake of going through different stages of life too fast and need to balance out work and life NOT Work hard now and life later.",0
74,"I realized that the secret to making a million is making better investment.  I bought my 1st home at 21 for 87k sold for 197k, 2nd home 170k and sold for 320k, 3rd 300k and sold for 589k and buyers paid all closing costs expenses etc Not making up to a million before retirement is unfulfilled retirement.!!",1
75,Opening this I thought he would be a snobby Googler begging about is income. But boy was I wrong. What a smart and responsible young man. At 22 I could have never lol! Good luck Ethan!,0
76,"This is the kind of stuff that motivates me to become the best I can be so my kids can have a great start, like how his parents did for him.",0
77,What a great guy! It would have been helpful to see how travel is factored into his budget since he mentioned that he spends a good amount on travel but it was excluded from the budget summary.,0
78,I’m also a Googler! I sit down googling stuffs all day!,0
79,What an outstanding young man ❤! I wish I had this discipline at his age.,0
80,Hold on here.  This kid graduated from Berkeley with a CS degree in 2 years.  He is not your normal person.  I graduated in 4 years and I had to do summer school and use my AP credits.  How did he do this?,0
81,"Im struggling to finish HS as a dropout as 22 years old whos also interested in software engineering and has been coding for 5 years, and similar to my friends hes also making a well deserved salary graduate salary

If only i could receese time and tell myself to not give up on school despite my circumstances, id be in the same position 😢",0
82,"For people, who tell others to avoid going to collage at all costs are giving others terrible advice. He is one example out of many, who are financially successful because they chose to go to college. All or nothing thinking is a terrible cognitive distortion that you want to reframe.",0
83,"It seems strange to study so hard and work at a top tech company only to retire at 35. You don't see Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and Warren Buffet going into their professions only to want to leave in 10-15 years. Great guy, though it seems like he's spent his youth doing nothing but to accumulate a lot of wealth without having a true passion for any.",0
84,gosh cnbc you're such a big help to us all! THANKS!!!,0
85,Saving $60000 in 2 years and making a six figure salary does not add up to 95% saved. I am confused. lol,0
86,This guy is living well but I would give more credit to his parents for setting him well. Where is a 13 yo getting his capital from to invest? He also needs his parent's permission to set up an account to invest. No mention of him working till he got his bachelor's too. His parents also paid for his college (even two years is a lot). His financial strategy initially was pretty risky which speaks volumes about his family support in case anything fails. Props to him for realizing that stable long-term investments are better.,0
87,This guy is outstanding. I hope he also prioritizes his health and works on healthy eating & regular exercise to maximize his life expectancy and overall happiness. Those are things young people don’t always think about.,0
88,Love this for him ! Super impressive ❤,0
89,"If y’all are teenagers thisbis the kind of path you want to take if you’re going to college. Learn investing early, commit to a high paying skill, choose a cost effective college if you’re going, do it fast and get to work. Aim to save 50% of your income. It will be difficult if you’re living above you means but even if you can’t hit 50% aiming for it will push you to do your best. All the best young ones.

And $5 million should be everyone’s bare minimum goal. You can actually live or $250-350k with that kind of nest egg.",0
90,"I agree with the comments. This is far from an average person. UC Berkeley computer science degree in 2 years. Masters in 1 year? That's impossible for 99.99% of us. Even making $196K a year, he does have a lot of fixed expenses, mainly that huge mortgage.  Anyway, it's whatever works for him.",0
91,Great story Ethan. Keep crushing it man!,0
92,This is one of the best episodes I’ve seen in a long time ! …very nice,0
93,Im surprised i didn't see more of this comment. i'm sure he'll grow to resent his decisions later in life and change his goal of retiring by 35,0
94,May I ask which investments are good? I've been looking at a few different ones but want others' opinions as well,1
95,"I started out with a financial advisor called ""Rochelle Dungca Schreiber"". Her honest approach gives me complete ownership and control of my positions, and her rates are incredibly affordable given my ROI. However, do your due diligence before contacting a financial advisor..",1
96,"Rochelle appears to be very knowledgeable. I found her webpage and read through her resume, educational background, and qualifications, which were all very impressive. She is a fiduciary, which means she will act in my best interests. So I scheduled a call with her.",1
97,"""It's quite a surprise that you're acquainted with her as well. I've had the privilege of gaining significant profits while learning and investing under her guidance for the past few months.

Her expertise in navigating various market situations is truly remarkable.""",1

103,"Took nothing but AP classes in high school, did summer school, and maxed out classes each semester and had no social life.",0
104,Sometimes there are programs within high schools in which you can graduate with both a high school degree and a associates at the same time. He could have graduated taking all of the general education requirements and when applying for U.C. Berkley  he would have junior standing. He could also take summer classes or ap courses as the other commenter mentioned.,0
105,He represents the 1% that are able to achieve at this level. It's unrealistic for the vast majority of the population. Some people are born special and with a little discipline and they become extra special. It's no competition. We just have to try our best.,0
106,Bro lost 80k in crypto trading??,0
107,Losing 80000 in crypto and not having fun in your youth sooner or later will cost you...,0
108," @flippingnickelsforaliving I'd say he's more like 0.5% if not 0.01%, considering his age.. very impressive!",0
109," @vanessaandreatta9098  what would cost him for not having fun in your youth? Can't think of any. A friendship? if you past 30 and have kids, most ppl no longer have friends anyway.",0
110,He might've been a transfer student,0
111," @flippingnickelsforaliving  it’s still something’s ppl can take away from this and apply, while not aiming to do everything the way he did it. We have to an opportunity to be better at trying our best everyday.",0
112,it's doable.,0
113,"In the years that there wasn’t much else to do, though.",0
114,Well he'll have all the financial freedom to find one once he's done.,0
115,At 13 he probably used his Lunar New Year money to invest. I usually got a couple hundred every year as a pre-teen. Asian kids learn budgeting early!,0
116,Easy to eat healthy at Google,0
117,"Eating healthy is hard with all the processed crap available even at Google, so that takes a little effort to research.  He can always subscribe to have keto meals sent to his home. He's a doughboy with career and money and  needs to hit the gym.",0
118,"OMG I love this, I to am 22 years old and live in OC. he has the same exact investing mindset as me, I started investing also at 13. All my friends thought it was boring until now.",0
119,"Gotta say, what an astoundingly well adjusted young man.",0
120,"This guy is killing it, happy to see Gen Z nail money management. It applies to all generations tbh",0
121,how did he do a BA in comp sci in only two years? he doesn't mention attending community college & then transferring into a 4-year institution so I'm just curious. I wonder if he also took summer courses during that time.,0
122,Great work Ethan!,0
123,"Unless Ethan doesn't pay property tax or insurance or any maintenance costs or save for vacancy and Capex, then he's actually losing money every month on this rental property in Florida.",0
124,"Although I like his spirit and determination, there were many red flags throughout this video and his comments on spending/income don't add up. And it feels like we're missing information. His current salary does not indicate one new investment property every 2 years, especially if he only makes $194 in profit each month. When he said he wanted to retire at 35 with $5 million, but also wanted to start a family soon I just laughed....this guy is a big dreamer. A family, even one kid, is very expensive.",0
125,"Holy crap this guy was a study demon - literally cutting his schooling time in half, insane",0
126,I wish I had my life together like this 😭,0
127,"Really nice guy---but is NOT the norm--he's that rare superstar @ 22!! Good for him.--he's truly superb in terms of his discipline, mindset determination, and maximizing all his skill sets!",0
128,Staying at home (if that’s an option) is a great way to get ahead. I did the same in order to purchase a home and jump start my investments.,0
129,I'm skeptical about being able to complete a computer science degree in 2 years as portrayed. He had to of either taken college equivalent courses in high school or went to community college and transferred in.,0
130,7:48 such a blessing to have great grandma still around,0
131,I realized that the secret to making a million is making better investment.,0

135,Everytime I watch regular people reaching their potieianl and dreams and makes me feel confident on doint it.,0
136,"his house looks like the meme of a software engineer in silicon valley.  nearly no furniture or decor, and a mattress on the ground.  think we are all interested in how he graduated in only 2 years, yet he explained zero.  he just stacked a ton of classes every semester and went to summer school?  seems really hard and stressful, but well done.",0
137,Can we please have some normal Gen Z's on here??? Someone in college hustling and budgeting super hard is a lot more interesting than people with so much money they can buy whatever they want without thinking about it.,0
138,"I am assuming he took a lot of AP classes in high school. so he doesn't have to do 1st year, go straigh to 2nd courses, then didn't take summer off.Using the summer semesters to finish more classes. therefore he can graduate in 2 years.. bascially, he never had a break for school for 2 years, no summer, no social life. just school, classes. I know ppl did that..",0
139,"I'm sure that's what he did... Probably took APs and community college courses during the end of high school, and berkeley counts a lot of those courses. I have another friend who did the same thing. 

I don't think there's any other way to really graduate in 2 years because there's a max number of credits you can take.",0
140,Seems like he might be over leveraging himself a bit...I love his enthusiasm and spirit,0
141,Which explains why he had to use debt to pay for the air conditioning unit.,0
142,"Property tax and insurance will be part of the mortgage payment (the escrow portion). But vacancy, maintenance, hoa, property mgmt, are not included).",0
143,Yes his housing payment is massive. Only $442 going to savings and investments seems low.,0
144,"Warning, a good daycare in OC is $2,000/mo per kid minimum haha. I have 2, get ready to add $4,000/mo to that budget good Ol Boy!  Welcome to the Thunderdome!",0
145,"Agreed, he’s dreaming",0
146,"I’m sure there’s some sacrifices that need to be done (ie not eating out a lot, not a lot of social gathering to spend money).

With his income level, 20% down payment for a home is FL is smaller compared to 20% down payment in California. Makes sense why he chose the investment property first",0
147,"Yes I noticed this as well. The pie chart said he is only saving and investing $442 a month. But then he said he invests almost $2,800 a month in retirement and non retirement account.",0
148,likewise !,0
149,So do it.,0
150,Crazy. All these strong and independent boss babes in the comments and on TikTok that can't stop crying about it.,0

158,"Hes normal? Just because hes smart and got a good job working for google doesnt make him an anomaly LOL. They have plenty of videos on here of ppl you're asking for..

Just because he had supportive parents, went to berkely(on his own merits), saved his money, and is successful at 22 doesnt mean we should not celebrate him or show him off.",0
159,That’s your opinion,0
160,What is a normal gen z? Poor and underachieving? Please enlighten us,0

163,I wish I could celebrate the guy and all but cmon you have your parents help at 13. Dude at 18 I was already paying rent and bills you think my parents set me up for life. Sometimes you don’t want to be jealous or envious of others but it’s very difficult to do so when other families are doing what you wish your parents should have been doing,0
164,He did hustle. It's no small feat to graduate in 2 years. Study hard in a technical field and you can end up like him,0
165," @edercortes1960 you’re playing the wrong game w this mentality my guy. You’re basing success by comparing yourself to others. You have to define success for yourself, so sure you can’t change your past but you DO have control over your life NOW, so how will you succeed? This guy is no different than you and I, this is just his story. And he saw success as making investments, whereas other people see success w material gain, higher status, healthy families, healthy weight etc. there’s no need to feel envy, we all are in different chapters, in different books. We can’t all have the same story",0

167, @jw6451 right??😂😂😂😂,0

169," @edercortes1960  the thing is, even though your parents didn’t set you up for success at a young age for whatever reason that’s what they chose to do, their actions led to them to not being able or care to to think proactively about their children, but if you think about it in a more accountable way you could just use your less than ideal upbringing from your parents as fuel to make sure your kids get the things you didn’t get growing up.

230,"If you're plan has a ""true up"" the front load is best. I get a true up payment every march of the following year when I front load.",0
231,"Not always. It depends on the plan.
I set percentage by dividing my base salary by the 401k limit, then rounding up to the next whole percentage point. Right now that works out to 19%. It means that I usually hit the max in early December. So I miss some matching.

However, my company gives me a true in in June of the next year. They give me what I missed by hitting the 401k limit before the final paycheck of the year.

If there is a bonus paid, then I hit the max earlier. But I set it to make sure I hit the max even without a bonus.

I don't like the idea of front-loading the 401k contributions to early in the year. First, I need some money to live on and to pay bills for the first quarter of the year. Next, by buying shares every two weeks, I get dollar cost averaging.",0
232," @yankinwaoz  you still get dollar cost avg if you front load, it's just on a different time interval. The idea with front load is that ""time in the market"" is the more important metric. But personally I don't think it's that much of a big deal. I try to complete 401k contributions by mid-year, and the main reason I do this is (a) get it out of the way early (b) if I have to change jobs or become unemployed towards the end of the year it will have no impact on maxing for that year.",0

302,Dont forget that California eats nearly half his salary,0
303, @BlowitAllUp  Only reason California salaries are higher than most places is because California itself is extremely expensive compared to the average place. Same as for New York. Yes the average salary is $40-$50K but you also have to factor in how many people do you know that wanna watch a video of a Walmart worker or factory worker? Remember this is YouTube we're watching so they have to find realistic jobs that the average person can pursue that are also going to attract viewership.,0

""profit"" of $194 form his rental is actually a loss after property tax.. buying such an expensive home in OC when rates are peaking will stunt his savings and postpone whatever retirement plans he had.

once he has kids, he won't qualify for any benefits at all due to his high income so he will need to pay for day care, which is another $1500+ per month per child.

380,Mortgage is high at $4.6k with his salary being $164k (excluding RSUs). Once he has a partner Im sure that will take some pressure off.,0
381,major in computer science is the smartest choice. Less schooling but higher pay,0
382,Good job Ethan 💰,0
383,Hes killing it execept for the crypto,0
384,How does this man have two houses by the age of 22? Parent's help?,0
385,This is the opposite of the kind of life I want for myself and my family. NO THANK YOU.,0
386,"He comes from a very well-off family... let's not try to sugarcoat it. Good for him, but that's not the average kid... His math ain't matching...how on earth did he save for 2 houses? Plus having other investments? He graduated at 19 so... unless he was making a lot of money since 13 investing, or his parents had helped him. Otherwise, I don't believe that someone at 22 can have investments and 2 houses lol by HIMSELVES without help.",0
387,Is this guy even human? what a beast,0
388,"I see a lot of praise for him, but he lost $80k on crypto and spends over $6k per month on housing (despite having two extra bedrooms in his home he could rent out). He says he saved 90% of his six-figure income but that only amounted to $60k in two years? A lot of this doesn't add up. He seems smart and sensible, but I think his well-spoken manner detracts from some poor financial decision making.",0
389,Are electricity bills in CA really that cheap?,0
390,Dude needs to move homes tho 👀,0
391,"$300-400 on take outs per month? And no cooking at home, that’s just not realistic.",0
392,Was anyone else nervous he wasnt gonna make that backflip?,0
393,wait... this guy has no money left to pay taxes!,0
394,"CS degree in two years, Jesus.",0
395,Lives alone and paying this mortgage? He could have easily rented this house and lived at the cheap house that he is currently renting.,0
396,"4 trips a year, a fast accelerating car, and 3 rooms to himself and any guests he wants -- how does this fit your definition at all",0
397,Exactly! One minor repair and his profit for the year is blown.,0
398,He doesn't NEED to and shouldn't! = Greed is the real problem w/this country!,0
399,The home is a mortgage.,0
400,"he's likely losing money when you factor in insurance, prop taxes, repairs and maintenance, management, etc.",0
401,Nowhere did it say his houses are paid off. He's still paying mortgages monthly on his primary residence and rent is covering the investment property.,0
402,Yeah how can you get your Masters and be working full time by 22?   Hmmm...,0
403,"In some high school where I am from, some kids finish all high school courses by grade 10. They are very clear with their goals and took as many AP classes as possible in high school, so they don't have to do them in college and save money.",0
404,I think he meant that he saved $60k in housing costs by living with family compared to if he had rented for 2 years,0
405,Extremely impressive. Would this be considered near-genius?,0
406,Please check back with him in another year when Google starts cutting jobs..........,0
407,"The investment amount is way too low and housing amount is way too high. The monthly housing percentage should not be more than 25% of the net, but he’s spending over 60% of his net in housing. TF does he need 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms when he’s living by himself?? 

Instead of taking ping pong lessons, he needs to take up cooking lessons for his sake of his health (physical and financial).

Finally, how did he graduate from Berkeley in 2 years with a CS degree?? I’m guessing he took a shitload of AP classes in HS… His parents have done him a massive disservice in pressuring him to attend college for only 2 years at the expense of enjoying his college years..",0
408,Oh he’s Cambodian. Good job.,0
409,Every Asian parent after seeing this video to their kid: “why u not doing this?!” 😡,0
410,Is it really hard to live off 194K???,0
411,And I hope he reads this ~ Live in the present dude. You are 22… doing too much long term planning. Make some friends. Get a girlfriend.,0

417,dude is a great catch for his future wife.,0
418,How he completed undergraduate degree in two years ?,0
419,Read in-between the lines is all I'm seeing. Hope he's well.,0
420,All that money can buy you a gym membership 👍,0
421,Underpaid. $134k base at Google? Yeah underpaid. Talk to your manager in 18 months mate. I’m more interested in how his take-home monthly is so high in California. I need to revisit my taxes,0
422,"He's house poor and there is not ""profit"" on his rental after accounting for maintenance. He's doing better than 99.5% of people though.",0
423,"I know this guy, he lives down the street from me. Lol",0
424,I want to meet him.,0
425,"Smart man! He's working hard to escape the rat race. I wish I had thought of that when I was young and applied myself more in my early 20s when I had more energy and time. Nowadays, I'm exhausted after work, cleaning, running errands, and making dinner that all I want to do is lay on the couch all evening... Plus, my back hurts now. 🥲",0
426,"he states ""it's fine"" but he almost speaks like an AI written article. he seems devoid of any personality",0
427,"Good points. He should be eating out less. And probably spending less on travel, which is definitely in his “wants“ category.",0
428,"Not really, its california, thats normal and sometimes low for us depending on the size of the house (i havent watched the full video), people are paying that amount for one bedroom apartments",0
429,That's the last thing bro needs right now.,0
430,It's doable. I'm not smart and didn't even work that hard in college and did it in 3 years. If you had a lot of AP classes  and really tried it's very doable. I know plenty,0
431,Anyone with a rich family could do this. Nobody with a poor family could do this.,0
432,"thanks, I needed to feel like a failure.",0
433,Having an electric car and your bill is only ~$200!? Naw something is up with that.,0
434,Overachiever! 😂,0

441,194k with debt make sense..🤣 I didn't finish college I trade full-time & made 7 figures in pandemic thank me later!!👀💪💯🦍,0
442,You gotta change it to Gen Z money soon because he's 22 years old he's not a millennial,0
443,Basically he's making no money on his property. Like when he had fix get the HVAC fixed.,0
444,Didn’t enjoy undergrad at the best university in world and lost $80k on crypto. Too much imbalance my guy.,0

451,"Not necessarily. I went to community college, received max financial aid growing up, father was making ~60k, and I'm now making 210K in tech (also OC) at a big tech in my mid 20's.",0
452,"Yeah I'm 35 in OC with 2 kids, paying $3,100/mo in rent for 3 Bed just 20 minutes further inland than this young stud.",0
453,OC housing is super expensive but at least it's cheaper than the bay area,0

475, @devv11  He is definitely the kind of guy with whom girls want to have fun.,0
476,It's called early maturity! He seems very happy & content already and doesn't have any complaints about not having a childhood. I didn't care to; I wanted to focus more on my education and making $$ later. I wish my parents taught me abt early investing!!,0
477,How much time could you possibly spend thinking about money and investing? It only takes up a lot of your time if you have no money 😂,0
478,Nah this dude definitely has no friends. Graduating from Berkeley in 2 years..I doubt he went out a single night.,0
479,Because he’s Cambodian American. His family and the Khmer ppl came from war not even 30 years ago. They don’t take lightly the opportunity you have in America to become something great.,0
